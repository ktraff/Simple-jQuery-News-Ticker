jQuery News Ticker
-----------------------------------
   	
A simple, easy-to-use news ticker that can be embedded into any html object.  Loosely based on a similar project found [here](http://www.jquerynewsticker.com/).
	 	 
Recommended for jQuery 1.4.x or above only (A very early version with support for with jQuery 1.3.2 is available from the website, but is missing some features and is no longer supported).
